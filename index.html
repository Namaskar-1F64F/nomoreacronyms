<h2>dont use acronyms, they are confusing</h2>

<p>its better to type the full thing out so people know exactly what you're talking about </p>


<p>if you use an acronym you require the people to already know the context around what you're talking about.
that shuts people out of the discussion immediately and doesn't let new people in </p>


<p>over the internet what's the point of an acronym? 
it doesn't save time it takes more time to understand immediately</p>


<p>and anyway seeing the direct meaning of something is always better than having to make a representation conversion in your brain</p>




<p> let's make the world easier and more friendly to new people at the table</p>
